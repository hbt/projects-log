<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve been accumulating keyboard shortcuts for years.
It peaked around my time using editors and IDE and my obsession of removing the mouse.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Around 2009, I started using vim heavily in a mod and started looking into adding keyboard shortcut to phpmyadmin .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>2010
Instead I found out about vimium, pretty sure it was on hackernews. I then jumped on it, looked into the code and [forked it adding many features](<a href="https://github.com/hbt/vimium" class="bare">https://github.com/hbt/vimium</a>)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>2011
Afterwards, I found out about vrome, but the code quality felt much better. Jumped in, [forked it, added a bunch of features.](<a href="https://github.com/hbt/vrome" class="bare">https://github.com/hbt/vrome</a>)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I contacted the author jinzhu and he gave me admin access.
He did a release behind my back, it had tons of experimental features and some bugs. Wasnt meant for release.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He then proceeded to rewrite the whole extension in coffeescript with no discussion. It kinda felt like all my work in JS was discarded and I stopped contributing.
In reality though, a lot of my work was translated to coffeescript and he did a good job keeping the best parts and giving me credit as a retired author a few years later.
Better communication would have helped us both.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Around 2013, I got really tired of the white flash bug combined with the lack of stylesheet injections.
Also, the vrome extension didnt allow me the level of customization I needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I switched to firefox, picked pentadactyl and used that for years. The same firefox version until a small update which created too much work to justify updating the browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2016, I had a browser that was clunky, didnt work very often, would crash with timeouts and connection reset, some pages werent supported or looked buggy, it was overall slow and tedious. I could not update the damn thing without risk breaking pentadactyl or doing more work to fix it again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Firefox market share and development tools were on the decline.
The decision to switch to chrome was made but first the white flash bug had to be fixed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fixed the white flash bug, fixed my vrome fork to work with latest google chrome, looked into alternatives and found cvim aka chromium-vim.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I proceeded to customize chromium and make it work in tandem with vrome. By the end, I no longer opened firefox and had no use for pentadactyl.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But now, I had 2 extensions doing pretty much the same thing and some weird bugs. Forked cvim, merged my work from vrome into it and disabled vrome.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is where I&#8217;m at now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Firefox + pentadactyl are gone. Vrome is gone. I have the browser I want and it works properly.</p>
