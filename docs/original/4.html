<p>Ideally, I want the white flash bug fixed in google chrome so I dont have to maintain a fork in the first place.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, since that&#8217;s not going to happen anytime soon and I have no interest in digging my heels into the codebase. Here. we. are.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are 2 aspects to maintaining the fork:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>stable binaries to be produced using the latest stable code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dealing with any merge conflicts as we update the code</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the changes are minimal, merge conflicts shouldn&#8217;t be a problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It would be great to somewhat automate the browser updating part. Problem is, it&#8217;s a giant pain in the ass and is time consuming to build for my platform, let alone other platforms. Dependency hell is waiting to happen, I just know it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Maybe have a VM and produce the binaries there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is some demand online for a fix, maybe it can be made economically viable so the costs for renting a VM + keeping up the latest version is spread amongst collaborators and customers.</p>
