<p>the cvim repo doesnt look maintained anymore and I&#8217;ve been adding features left and right.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think that&#8217;s what I really want:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>target advanced users, developers and potential contributors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make it a cluster fuck of features and options that are not enabled but available for mapping. i.e 100% the complete opposite of vimium</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embrace the organized chaos</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make sure it works top notch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build a community of advanced users</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can benefit in many ways:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="good-pull-requests">Good pull requests</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stuff like the recent pull for the manifest to be compatible with latest chrome canary. I wouldn&#8217;t have experienced that until I updated the browser and the manifest didn&#8217;t load then spend time debugging and figuring out. That&#8217;s fucking maintenance and avoided thanks to that pull request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimizations</p>
</li>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>People sharing cool new commands or features that match my browsing pattern and I wouldn&#8217;t have thought of.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>interesting configs and such e.g cvim CSS hints, cool mappings, custom functions etc.</p>

<p>I already attracted people sending pull requests, contacting my fork for feature requests and following/starring me. That&#8217;s without any:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>quality - better documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>marketing - mainly having a homepage + rebranding + sharing on google chrome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recruiting - approaching the watchers and forkers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encouraging advanced users - having examples of configs, sharing configs/mappings etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One thing is certain, I don&#8217;t want to turn this into a job doing support. It has to be economically viable (time, money, energy).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Maybe monetize parts of the documentation like the guides. Advanced users are already familiar with vim or pentadactyl and will skip the guide.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Monetizing the extension itself on the chrome store would be kinda scummy since I didn&#8217;t write it and the free version is right next door. However, it would filter out the crowd. I&#8217;d still keep the code open source but charge for it anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There has to be some business model around this that doesn&#8217;t suck and makes the maintenance + community moderation a breeze .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Get more people who are most likely to be contributors rather than passive watchers. That&#8217;s why, fuck the average user and focus on advanced users.</p>
