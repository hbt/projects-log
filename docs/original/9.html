<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about building a mouseless chrome extension that I could sell for years.
Since 2012, when discussing vrome, I thought about monetizing it somehow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think, it is pretty clear at this point that this would be useless.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the best chrome extension is cvim. In terms of functionality but also something I&#8217;d use, it is not the most popular though.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most popular is vimium. Mainly because it has a minimal feature set and is ideal for beginners.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem I have right now is any work to monetize the extension would consist of bringing mouseless to the average user.
The average user who:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>doesnt want to spent any time customizing stuff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>doesnt want to spend time learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>expects things to work etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a few advantages to be gained by bringing to the average users but not enough to justify the amount of work + risk .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keep in mind, if I do this, there would be a big risk of people not showing up or being satisfied with the free versions etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key technical advantages I&#8217;d gain are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>better hinttags and other user defined stuff&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that&#8217;s assuming the majority of people are not passive and it&#8217;s worth having hinttags for sites that I dont visit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>better bug detection / software quality?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I cant think of what there is to gain really.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bringing it to the majority of users would be an education app. After they reach their education, they might be tempted to switch to the free version.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s not like chromium-vim is super buggy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Maybe that would be the tool instead. An education/gamification app or book or whatever.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Learn chromium-vim, pentadactyl etc. and would have documentation, gifs, community scripts, examples, wikis etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not sure where the monetization would be or even if there would be traffic but most importantly, what&#8217;s in it for me?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think I just need a break from this project for awhile. I had some ideas about yubnub like features, cli for the web and whatnot.</p>
