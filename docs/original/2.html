<p>The chromium white flash is this fucking annoying bug that has existed forever.
Basically, a white flash appears whenever you change tabs, new tab, click a link, open a window, begin to relax. [explained here](<a href="http://youtu.be/HfJ_EwSTevI" class="bare">http://youtu.be/HfJ_EwSTevI</a>)
Instead of browsing while enjoying ads ridden pages and lag, you have to experience the equivalent of getting flash banged in call of duty every few seconds.</p>

<p>Like every problem in life, it&#8217;s only worth solving when it really pisses you off. My frustration with white flash has been building over the years slowly.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>2007, began changing the background colors of site to relax my eyes in firefox.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2008, began experiencing migraine and eye strain. It was a combination of poor sleeping habits, poor lighting and working during the evening</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2009, none of the sleeping issues were addressed but used global stylesheets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2010, browsing in black and white and switching to chrome on linux. The white flash story begins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2011-2013, white flashes appear but it&#8217;s not as bad because we have custom stylesheet injection reducing the effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2013, chromium team [removes custom stylesheets](<a href="https://codereview.chromium.org/64843004" class="bare">https://codereview.chromium.org/64843004</a>) and I switch to firefox.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2013-2016, using firefox and not experiencing any issues with white flashes except when I have to test something on chrome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2016, firefox is increasingly a dead end and chromium is becoming the default browser. Must switch to chrome and fix the white flash.</p>
