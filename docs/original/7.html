<p>Definitely not worth monetizing. The white flash crowd is loud but they are not that numerous.
Although, I do get 50 unique visitors a week now as of Jan 2017. Very few follow through and download the binaries (for ubuntu).
Shoulda tracked the windows ones.</p>

<p>I guess some are intimated or lost by the repository page and expect something more friendly.</p>

<p>Jonathan forked and built on top of my fix and did a great job fixing the colors [<a href="https://github.com/imatimba/darker-chromium" class="bare">https://github.com/imatimba/darker-chromium</a>](<a href="https://github.com/imatimba/darker-chromium" class="bare">https://github.com/imatimba/darker-chromium</a>)</p>

<p>Too small a market and too much work (marketing, support, updates) for little pay despite all the voiced frustrations.
Maybe I could have known this from the google search results, product forums views, google trends and such. I was counting on people being as frustrated as I am with the bug to justify using a fork. Few are.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Still worth fixing for myself and still worth sharing since other people built on top the fix and improved the solution.</p>

<p>Putting the project on hold for now.</p>
