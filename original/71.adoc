## end goal

 "I want to listen to podcast/lectures from youtube while I run errands."


## Iteration 1

Easy peasy. 

. Download the youtube app
. Play the video

// TODO(hbt) add image youtube player

### Issues

. Internet is not cheap nor fast in Canada.
.. Find a youtube offline app 
. Advertisements in the youtube app are distracting/annoying 
.. Find another app like "youtube red" to skip/remove advertisements
. Often don't need the video since I can't watch it, only need the audio. Turning off the phone, pauses the video.
.. Download the video and extract the audio
. Nothing can be done with the phone while youtube app is on.
.. Use a regular media player to play downloaded content
. Sometimes content is from other sources too e.g vimeo or soundcloud
.. download video from more than source.

## Iteration 2

You can search the google play store for a multitude of youtube apps that do what you want. Trying them one at the time and perhaps even buying some.
Normally at this point, people accept a compromise. I can do this but not that, too bad, "c'est la vie". They get frustrated and move on. 
 
 
For the small minority of people technologically savvy enough, they will do a google search.
A google search is only fruitful if you know the domain. Otherwise, you are inundated by sleazy websites promising what you want and under delivering.

Examples:

. https://www.google.ca/search?ei=c5r3WYK1H6u4jwS1-bjYAg&q=extract+audio+from+youtube&oq=extract+audio+from+&gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.0i20i263k1j0l9.1921.11631.0.12449.32.25.7.0.0.0.208.2813.5j15j2.23.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..2.30.2940.6..35i39k1j0i67k1j0i131k1j0i131i46k1j46i131k1.116.yTlo1smHOko
. https://www.google.ca/search?ei=PJr3WePSNaXijwTllqSIDg&q=download+youtube+videos&oq=download+youtube&gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.0i131k1j0i20i263k1j0l8.49991.51720.0.53560.16.12.0.0.0.0.275.1573.0j7j2.9.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..7.9.1564...35i39k1.0.dbEocb1DBOI


You can actually find really great tools e.g https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/video-converter

Problem solved!

// TODO(hbt) add screenshot https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/video-converter

Here are the steps the user has to perform each time they want a video on their phone:
 
. copy the youtube url
. go to https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/video-converter
. paste the youtube url
. click "Start"
. wait
. Click "Download mp3"

If you have multiple videos or a playlist, repeat this process for each one. 


### Issues

. This is tedious and repetitive (especially if you want multiple videos)
.. Automate the download to audio conversion


## A quick recap

At this point, we lost the vast majority of users. At each iteration, the solutions get better but accessibility to said solution gets worse.

To recap, here is what we are asking from users:

### notice a problem and be proactive. 

 "I want to play youtube videos but it is not economical to do it on my cellphone plan. Do I give up on what I want? blame government sanctioned oligopolies and rant about rich greedy telecom owners?  or do I look for an alternative solution?"

### understand the domain and basic concepts.
 
 "Youtube is an app. Advertisements are not ingrained in the video but are separate. A video is a file and can be broken download into images and sound. The data does not reside in youtube but on a site/server. Can I use something other than an app to access that data? Can I use a browser? Another app?"
 
### find alternative solutions and evaluate them

  "If youtube is an app and not just a magic icon that was installed on my phone when I bought it. Can I go to the playstore, find other apps, install them, evaluate them, breakdown their features as independent systems, compare them and find a better fit?"
  "If the youtube app on my phone is just an interface, can I do a google search with the right keywords, find another tool to access the video, download it ... ?"
  
### Identify the manual steps involved in the solution 

  "I have to do all these steps, maybe I don't have to. Maybe there is a better way. Maybe I can do something about improving this solution"




People are not stupid but generally ignorant about the domain and its complexity. They often build their own model of reality and belief system and use them to operate around the world. 

This doesn't account for personality and emotions; people who get angry/frustrated easily, people who give up at the first sign of a challenge, people who are "afraid to break it" because no one is around to fix it etc.


All of these people with their different backgrounds and understanding of the world force you to fragment your product. They each represent a significant enough market segment and yet you cannot design something to be a perfect fit for all of them.

That is the frustration of product development. You have to pick your market segment, build a solution for each one of them. 
The language used by the software has to fit how your segment models reality.


More people using your product means it has to please the lowest common denominator. Needs of the many ...



## What if

What if you could create an interface that anyone could wrap their heads around?
A simple pattern anyone can understand.


`Input -> Transformation -> Output`


What if the interface was just plain english and it adjusted automatically to your understanding of the world by learning from people like you? No matter how small your customer segment, *someone alreayd tried to do what you want to do*. 

Why are repeating the same work individually over and over?


What if you could easily create, share and consume automated systems (software)? 

What if independent systems could communicate with each other with no prior agreement?

What if you could easily scale your computational resources based on your needs?


This is what we are going to build
