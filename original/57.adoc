I dont think I'm gonna push the idea too far. Some aspects of it are common across all functions and it's worth building those components. 

Strings prototyping offers an oversimplication. 

However, I have no use for most of those functions at the moment and would rather not spend time writing wrappers / documentation for them. i.e the grunt work aspect of building them up once the all components exist.
