## Iteration 7

Now that we have all the utilities dockerfied and easily callable using docker compose with entrypoints. 

We can rewrite the video converter script to use the dockerfied utils. 

Since we moved from one docker image to multiple images, it means we scale up the components as needed.
Example: we can run youtube-dl on one vm but use ffmpeg on different vms since it takes 1 CPU per file


The problem with docker components is how to link them. We have 3 options:

- docker siblings
- docker in docker
- docker duh


### Docker siblings 

Install docker in the dockerfile
Mount the docker socket and use docker. 

This does not make more secure. docker will run on the host and mounting volumes uses the host's path instead of the container


### Docker in Docker

Run it with `--priviliged` flag and put docker in docker. 

- You have to start the docker service each time which defeats the purpose of small scripts with many dependencies.
- It takes more disk space since you have to pull the dependencies in a separate docker volume

### Docker 

Put everything in the image. Basically keep what we have done in previous iterations. 

In the case of something like the video-converter project, it's fine. However, since the goal here is to build a framework to add/publish/run functions easily, it's worth skipping this option.

We don't need to break the image to scale up either. We can simply run the same image and use different entrypoints. 



*None of these options will work remotely since we cannot allow any user to mount/access everything in the VM*
