Since the idea of a schema to connect REST apis is what I believe is holding us back. I need to investigate + prototype a system where

### existing REST APIs can be schematized *without* any work/permission from API developer.

- Take an output from a REST API
- Schematize it
- Take another output with different params. Run Schema for validation + mapping


If the API developer does not have to provide a schema, it means less people to convince and faster growth.

### convert/manipulate data from one schema to another. 

- Schematize 2 APIs
- Write a converter/mapper from one schema to another
- Feed output from API 1 into API 2 with minimal boilerplate code
- Add more schemas and mappers to convert recursively
