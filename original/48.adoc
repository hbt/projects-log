== doc objective

. clarify vision + structure of systems
. organize thought


== end goal

. list of functions callable over the cloud abstracting complex functionality into simple + accessible calls and executable over any platform


== function registry

. list of functions. similar to dockerhub or github. create functionshub
. easy to add new ones, fork and collaborate
. google index equivalent of functions
. can run registry over cloud or local
. community owned

=== metrics

. nb functions

=== flaws/concerns

. dealing with contributions, custom functions and forking
. no technical advantage  - google search algo vs google index

=== leap forwards

. github/dockerhub like hosting for OSS
. accessibility, ease of use, ease of mashups (no install, piping/mashing up)


=== design

. REST api definition 
. reliable intercommunication for mashups (json versioning, protocol buffers)
. integration with platform (matchers, logging, issue reporting etc.)
. inline testing
. versioning
. pricing / billing
. optimized
. oss

== function hosting

. built on of registry
. hosting + billing per use
. offers caching, storage and other range of APIs to make it easier to run/write/debug/analyze functions
. offers hidden optimizations



== UI

. built on top of registry and hosting
. multiple UIs (cli, language wrappers, web, mobile, api) 
. mash functions together with ease (inv nimbletext and complex piping)


== UX

. must be mainstream friendly without sacrificing power users. powerful and easy
