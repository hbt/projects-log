## latest binary fixes

Fixed the youtube live issue due to codec missing. 

## docker

Dockerfied the project here for https://github.com/hbt/chromium-white-flash-docker and docker image available under hbtlabs https://hub.docker.com/u/hbtlabs/

## latest code update

Building for latest versions will require a new fix since the code has changed (even though it is only 2 lines). Works up to v59 maybe v60
