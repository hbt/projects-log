## what I want 

I've been using "Ok Google" lately. It's extremely limited and defaults to a web search for most requests.
But the idea is a solid one. That's how we should interact with computational knowledge and APIs.


I want to tell the machine what to do, it breaks it down and does it. This is achievable with current technological state.


## Step 1 - Add more actions to make assistants smarter

Current assistants have hardcoded tasks like "set an alarm", "add a calendar event" etc. 
They perform those tasks because they've been programmed to do so. 

The first step is adding more actions by making available all those online APIs. 

The issue with APIs is they are:

- scattered
- inaccessible 
- "machine unreadable" 
- hosting/scalability & pricing

### Scattered

There is a few collection of APIs like https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis or mashape.com or programmableweb.com
If you visit those sites, you will see a list of URLs with general descriptions. 
That's with official APIs and REST apis. 
Some are hidden behing private API gateways. Most have no UI and are hidden behind code or regular binaries. 


This is solved by: 

- Centralizing the REST APIs in one location (like github did for OSS) and breaking down the actions of the API rather than marketing buzzword descriptions


### Inaccessible

This is solved by:

- dockerfying - fixes the dependencies/platform/packaging problems
- restifying - make the API easily accessible
- Dockerfying and Restifying binaries. Example: https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/ as a service or ffmpeg as a service


### Machine unreadable

Even though we have tons of REST APIs on mashape.com and are accessible in a somewhat programmable way, it remains complete giberrish to a machine (and even a human with minimal domain knowledge) without a schema.

A schema to represent what the data means allows you not only to validate input/output but manipulate the data and convert it. 
This is the key missing element despite the technology already existing in the form of json-schema, protocol buffers, rpc etc.

Without a schema, you have to write boilerplate code to connect APIs together. Boilerplate means human input. 
Eliminating the boilerplate code means a machine can use multiple REST APIs through schema and mappers.


## Step 2 - Connect actions. Compute knowledge

With centralized list of APIs that are schematized, you can connect REST calls to perform complex actions. 
You could say "get all gmail attachments and upload them to S3". The NLP could get this right with a proper schema knowing that gmail is a service, attachments are objects, S3 is another service, upload is an action etc.

This is not possible today without writing boilerplate code to connect all those REST calls.


I believe in Wolfram vision of computational knowledge. We have to break down API to a single unit of computation and build the links in order to perform complex tasks.


## Step 3 - Make it easier to build APIs

This is the step I started at and it was "sort of a mistake". 
There is no point in making it easier to build APIs; people already build them. The problem is lack of discovery/exploration/accessibility etc. 

Developers who want to build an API will figure out a way to build it. Even if it is a single file exposing a web server and responding to get/post requests; it still counts as an API. 

The idea of a platform is a great one but there is tons of competition and having a platform will not fix the fact that we have APIs that are inacessible.
