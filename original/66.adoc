## what I want 

I've been using "Ok Google" lately. It's extremely limited and defaults to a web search for most requests.
But the idea is a solid one. That's how we should interact with computational knowledge and APIs.


I want to tell the machine what to do, it breaks it down and does it. This is achievable with current technological state.


## Step 1 - Add more actions to make assistants smarter

Current assistants have hardcoded tasks like "set an alarm", "add a calendar event" etc. 
They perform those tasks because they've been programmed to do so. 

The first step is adding more actions by making available all those online APIs. 

The issue with APIs is they are:

- scattered
- inaccessible 
- "machine unreadable" 

### Scattered

There is a few collection of APIs like https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis or mashape.com or programmableweb.com
If you visit those sites, you will see a list of URLs with general descriptions. 
That's with official APIs and REST apis. 
Some are hidden behing private API gateways. Most have no UI and are hidden behind code or regular binaries. 


This is solved by: 

- Centralizing the REST APIs in one location (like github did for OSS) and breaking down the actions of the API rather than marketing buzzword descriptions


### Inaccessible


// TODO(hbt) NEXT reuse previous 
tons of OSS completely inaccessible to regular people and even developers.
current rest apis are inaccessible -- unreable prices, rest/json is like wtf for normal people, weird json


advantages of dockeerfying and restying

- Dockerfying and Restifying binaries. Example: https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/ as a service or ffmpeg as a service


It is barely usable as a human and completely useless to machines


### Machine unreadable

too much boilerplate and buggy spagetting code
json-schema / protocol buffers


## Step 2 - Connect actions. Compute knowledge

Wolframalpha 
create complexity
what it means to compute
exploration of actions through schema


## Step 3 - Make it easier to build APIs

why starting here was the wrong approach
existing attempts
people will spaghetti
