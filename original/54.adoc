== faas frameworks

. https://github.com/serverless/serverless most popular  on github when it comes to faas
. https://github.com/bigcompany/hook.io related to microcule
. https://github.com/Stackvana/microcule functinos and processes -- good streaming implementation for piping . used by hook.io
. https://github.com/alexellis/faas package processes as functions
. https://github.com/funktionio built on top of Kubernetes (but many languages?)
. https://github.com/iron-io/functions - hot functions implementation is clumsy. starts and stops containers with a server on top for routing
. https://github.com/fission/fission functions only (nodeJS and python only) doesnt look well maintained (outdated docs and such)

== great writing on faas and future of programming

. good faas review 2016 https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html
. the archive is worth reading through - last at Jan 2014 or 2013 (check history) http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/10/bringing-etl-to-the-masses-with-apis/
. perfect explanation of the problem and solution http://pchiusano.github.io/2013-05-22/future-of-software.html  Applications can and ultimately should be replaced by programming environments, explicitly recognized as such, in which the user interactively creates, executes, inspects and composes programs. In this model, interaction with the computer is fundamentally an act of creation, the creative act of programming, of assembling language to express ideas, access information, and automate tasks
