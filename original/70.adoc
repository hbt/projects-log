## What I want

I want to speak/type in plain english general actions to perform and for the machine to do it.

Example:

- I visit a youtube music video and want the music on phone. 
- I say: download the video then extract the audio then upload file to google drive
- the assistant will get it done


## Is this possible today in 2017?

Yes, it is. The technology is mature enough to build stuff like this. 

What is needed is:

- voice recognition 
- basic natural language processing and matching to commands
- programs/functions sitting on the cloud waiting to be called
- user interface for feedback and clarifications


## technology breakdown


### voice recognition

google api is as good as it gets - https://cloud.google.com/speech/

### natural language processing

Several apis like

- api.ai
- wit.ai

### cloud functions

Plenty of open source programs that are inaccessible to the public as cloud functions.

All we need to do is dockerfy the code, restify it as a service, schematize the inputs/outputs and associate the "trigger words" for NLP. 
Then faas it, scale as you wish and pay per compute.

// TODO(hbt) NEXT add breakdown of jargon


### UI & feedback

Same as google assistant command requesting a clarification as an input. This is doable at a larger scale if the inputs/output are schematized.


## current state of intelligent assistants

Before reinventing the wheel, let's look at existing intelligent assistants

// TODO(hbt) NEXT expand what google assistant lacks
What they all lack:

// TODO(hbt) NEXT expand on process for adding new GA commands/actions
- easy to extend and add new commands
// TODO(hbt) NEXT expand on calendar example
- handling any complexity or diverging from expected input (no adaptation/learning either)
// TODO(hbt) NEXT expand on abstraction/new keywords
- customization
// TODO(hbt) NEXT list features/actions available
- highly limited
