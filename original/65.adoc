I've learned a lot over the past few months and the vision has solidified and not changed that much. 

I still want a functions as a service hub that will be used by intelligent systems.

However, I'm going the wrong way about it. I'm spending a lot of time building a faas platform over GCP and eliminating the steps to dockerfy and restify software. 

Although I will need this, it is taking too fucking long and some systems are being reinvented poorly.


The current system is scalable but is not the right approach at this point in time. I believe focusing on the platform is not the most effective way to achieve my goal.
Instead, I should be focusing on connecting existing APIs. 

There are already API marketplaces like mashape.com or listing on github like https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis

Even when I finish my faas platform, it will be competing with other platforms and developers still have to "convert" their software to faas. 
Although I can use the platform for my personal projects, that is not the end goal. 

The best way to achieve exponential progress at this point in time is to:


. focus on existing REST APIs
. connect them using a schema (json schema or protocol buffer or whatever)
