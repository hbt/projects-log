== Gist of experiment 
A quick experiment centered around this idea is to build an awk equivalent utility tool. 

It would be available via the cli, you can transform strings like linux pipe commands and using multiple functions or straight up using the php wrapper. 

You should also be able to add new functions, publish them and make them available in the cloud. 

Limiting data type to strings only for now. 

There are already tools to provide faas. see if those can be reused + wrapped up and built upon. This way, I can focus on the wrapper instead of services + infrastructure. 

== flow

. add function that inserts block of text between 2 identified blocks  -- regex example http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=7633
. publish version on cloud
. write fh wrapper for cloud calls and multi strings functions
. cat file | fh "function_call('bl_start', 'bl_end', 'insert_text').trim()"

== tools 

. http://swagger.io/
. https://webtask.io/cli#


== experiment 

wrote 2 functions with webtask. problem is limitations in the language, environment etc. 
I need full flexibility and that means firing docker containers without whatever is inside of them.

// TODO(hbt) NEXT add ideas to mindmap
fh should handle the CPU/RAM needs by monitoring usage. If the function is using 100% CPU, move it to a higher instance and increase the price. Same with RAM. 
Or maybe offer option for user to run on lowest or highest speed in the future.
