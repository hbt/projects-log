From 55, context switching was the most annoying and time consuming aspect. 

If I can streamline that, I will reduce the dev of a function.


== ideal workflow

. create empty folder
. create file in language x with functions in them
. document functions inputs(main input)/outputs/assertions etc. with annotations in the file
. use fh local test to:
.. build the docker file
.. build your functions definitions
.. run your tests - if missing deps are found, auto-correct
. fh remote deploy
.. deploys image on functionhub 
.. version it
.. run tests
