== marketing chromium white flash fix

since the windows binaries have been produced and the github repo has gained some work. I want to get more contributors for several reasons:

- have the built maintained for me on other platforms
- get better solutions implemented 
- be notified when people get something better


This can be measured by the number of downloads, traffic, feedback, visits, gihub stars etc. 

What I dont want:

- answer dummy questions from users. Most of them unlikely to contribute anything. 
- do any extra work on the fork


## marketing strategy

- focus on google links of popular sites and contact authors to notify them of latest fix
- do reverse search and contact the sites that made the top links popular


## approach

- github pages instead of README + focused on end-users to get them to download and try it right away
- FAQ for common questions 


## steps

- find keywords
- extract list of links + authors
  - use google searches
  - check for refs to chrome bugs about white flash
  - reverse the searches 
- fix github pages, faq, readme
- contact authors and followups
- review traffic, gh stars and other metrics

## find most valuable / influencial links

where influencial is:

- appears high in google results
- has multiple views + replies + followups
- uses social media and can trend (reddit,twitter)


## feedback + followups

- contacted people on reddit - several users
- updated superuser questions
- contacted a few people via productforums g+ because the google groups does not allow replies
- tweeted to a few people 

## traffic metrics

- https://www.reddit.com/message/inbox/
- https://twitter.com/

## other ideas

consider registering to chrome google groups productforums + emailing whenever a mention is made about white flash
you can get daily summaries and use a gmail filter for flagging. 

Why? because I can't comment on old threads and people have their emails hidden. I could google them and find their email, but that's a lot of work. 


## feedback

- People need a direct link for binaries - i.e a github pages instead of README
- People don't read README (duh) and expects a direct download + install ala google chrome
- People keep posting about google sync and other stuff not working (despite clearly explained in README)
- Only works for very frustrated people experiencing the bug. Some people claim to be frustrated but are not willing to actually put a bit of effort.

Out of all the marketing, tweets, reddit, stackoverflow etc. Only one highly influencial user turned out to be worth it and drove a lot of new traffic.
