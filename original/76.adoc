## Iteration 7


## Issues:

- cross-communication between containers is better achieved with a gateway than docker-compose

even if the mounting of volumes is solved in docker siblings, it still requires a lot of hackish and know-how to make it work


- existing gateway tools are either buggy or barely developed


iron-functions has barely been touched and is lacking. openfaas is actively being developed but buggy.
Forking + Patching the existing work would create a maintenance nightmare. Writing indepedent patches to work around the normal behavior would take more time than simply building properly in the first place.

- docker package management and scripting should be limited until this is solved

Exposing binaries via docker containers is okay. Configuration of binaries + services. Scripting however should be limited to 1 container. No communication for now.
