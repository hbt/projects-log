== end goal

build a tool capable of manipulating strings. 
Goal is not the tool itself since:

- already has tools like nimbletext textmechanic awk etc.
- 300ms docker container start. 


However, building a string prototype will allow:

- raw code across languages and interlinked
- focus on function registry definition
- focus on wrappers + uis
- focus on scaling and distributed computing
- identifying services + areas of optimization e.g hot functions / container reuse



After this tool is developed and the infrastructure systems identified,  any code can be executed and abstracted using.
Next is to apply this to processes and replicate the youtube-dl experiment.

== UX 

fh = functionshub cli tool


Examples (wip):

for each row, add row length at the end

wrapper:

fh split "\n"
fh map 
  row append row.length
fh join "\n"  

cli:

cat file | fh split "\n" | map | append 1.size | endmap | join "\n"

ruby:

v = File.read
arr = fh(v).split("\n")
arr.map do |a|
  fha = fh(a)
  fha.append(fha.size())
v = fh(arr).join("\n")  


ruby with arrays on fh:

v = File.read
fh(v).split("\n").map('
