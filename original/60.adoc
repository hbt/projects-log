I'm struggling with maintaining control over the project and retaining a high ROI on activities I undertake. 


Taking a metrics oriented approach and keeping track of workflows, goals and enhancements. 

It's easy to build systems but refactoring, testing and keeping the overall design tight is another matter.


My approach is to get it to work first. It's fine if it's not perfect, if it doesn't scale, if it doesn't handle every weird edge case.
I make a note of it, write a // TODO(hbt) XXX // TODO(hbt) ENHANCE XXX or // TODO(hbt) Refactor (low): XXX etc.

The problem with this approach is it's very hard to visualize and know what the overall workflow is (without having to dig through the code) or know how that workflow impacts on which lead/lag metrics.


There is no tool out there that I know of capable of providing a linkage between all those elements to prevent things from getting out of control.

I think it's worth investigating a few tools related to metrics/analystics/logging. It will be a major component and I really want to keep it for later but just from the recent end2end prototype, I can already feel overwhelmed by the workflows, the number of components and their interractions and all the enhancements that need to be made.
