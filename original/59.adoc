It's too easy to get lost doing shit that doesn't matter or focusing on the wrong thing. 

The strings prototype experiment did its job. Identify the components, build a quick prototype, run speed tests and determine feasibility.

I have no interest in strings manipulation at the moment.


== mvp or what?

the focus on mvp, what customers want etc. is the wrong approach at this stage. The goals are aligned but spending time building something someone else *might* (big emphasis on might) find useful vs me simply needing it. 

The latter is more of what I want. I need to dockerfy some programs because it's a nightmare to maintain them or have to deal with software updates or stuff breaking when it used to work. 
Docker solves that. It simply works forever. Well, until the timestamps go to shit.


== what i need

What I need is the ability to create functions easily and use them via a wrapper. Basta.
