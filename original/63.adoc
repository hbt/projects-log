## dedicate the time it requires

Already wrote about this in another project but should be extracted here as it applies to all projects.

Having a schedule with dedicated daily chunk of time for the project helps accelerate the rate of progress.

The issue is not finding the time but be willing to deprioritize other stuff; it is a matter of discipline rather than time management. 


A good question to ask is: "can this wait?" Can it wait a day, a week, until the project is finished, can it wait forever, does it matter?
Or take the psycho ROI approach and ask: "how will ABC improve my life compared to XYZ?" Pick the one that will have the biggest impact.


## cost of focus

Focus is the one thing constantly being repeated and it is rarely explained. 

What it means is not only paying attention to what you are doing but picking the *right* thing. It means *NOT* undertaking other activities despite their appeal because they have no effect on advancing the goal. 

Focus is not limited to actions but also your thoughts. Dealing with anxiety, apprehension about the future, events out of your control is one thing; focus is also about controlling a train of thought *not* because it will lead to nowhere but because it is not a priority. 

Focus is about paying attention to the most effective path and rein in any deviation in thoughts or actions. 

One way to think about it is: since focus is limited to one thing, find out if it worth the cost (time, energy, opportunities (other experiences/activities etc.)) and pay it or move on.

It is not a sacrifice and it shouldn't cause you suffering if you believe it to be the best move for you.




## podoro 

Pomodoro technique supposedly helps with this. It's not just about working in 30 minutes chunk. 
It's about organizing your work into tasks that fit that 30m chunk and recognizing deviations, distractions, interruptions. 


It's rather difficult to write code that way because shit happens. A tool doesn't work as expected, something could be refactored now, you find a related bug, new idea for enhancement comes up etc. 
The goal is not to ignore them, you write them down but do not deal with them immediately. 

Pomodoro forces you to stick with that task because at the end of that 30m, you should have the envisioned end result or start questioning your planning. 

What were the known unknows that you missed in your planning phase?


## podoro workflow

Planning:

- pick most effective task with highest ROI
- envision end result
- break task into small chunks
- assign a time block to each chunk. No larger than 30m
- assign a metric (if relevant) applying lead/lag ideas


Execution: 

- execute the task 
- when shit happens, work around it, log it for later and resume work. Stick to timeframe

Review:

- did you stick to timeframe? 
-- Yes, great. Review the shit that happened and deal with it or schedule it for later.
-- No? Find out why. Poor planning? lack of focus during execution?
- adjust plan and continue
