5. WRITING

Benefits: Whether it’s emails or journaling or writing fiction or posting a political rant on Facebook, writing well is fast becoming one of the most important life skills in the 21st century. So much of your life today is spent in front of a screen and through social media, email and messaging apps, so if you can’t communicate well through writing, you’re putting yourself at a monstrous disadvantage.

If reading allows you to inhabit other people’s minds for a brief period of time, learning to write well is like cleaning your house before the guests come over — it forces you to learn how to structure your thoughts more coherently, string together rational arguments, and tell stories in cogent and insightful ways. But not only that, it makes you a better and more insightful thinker. As Flannery O’Connor said, “I don’t know what I think until I write it down.”

It’s also therapeutic. In fact, of all of the hokey pokey woo-woo self-help practices, journaling and writing out one’s thoughts and feelings on a regular basis has been shown to have calming and therapeutic effects.24

Adoption Strategy: Easiest way here is to start a journal. There are some cool apps to journal on your computer. Or you can do it the old-fashioned way, by hand.25

The important thing here is to not limit yourself. Use writing as a tool of self-discovery; write your feelings, ideas, fantasies. And if you feel like going on a tangent about calculus problems that stumped you, do that too.

If you get ballsy, you can even start a blog at a site like WordPress or Medium and go public with your ideas.

The point here is to develop a consistent habit of 1) uninhibited self-expression and 2) practice formulating your thoughts in a highly coherent way so that others may understand them. Start with 30 days. As usual, don’t judge yourself. At first, make simply showing up the only requirement for success.
