It is increasingly clear to me that a business is the only best path forward. 


All other forms of generating income involve tying yourself to someone and reliquinishing a great deal of freedom and power. 

The classics:

=== Employee

Money path:

. Join a company. 
. Generate value beyond the job you got hired to do. 
. Hope you get compensated fairly and not screwed.

Upsides:

. stable salary regardless of value generated. "Just doing my job"

Downsides:

. general lack of freedom 
. can be a deadend in terms of generating more income (compartmentalized organizations, bureaucracies, poor network opportunities etc.)
. compensation for generated value comes much later and is out of your control
- dealing with legacy code and junk created by others. Almost always.



=== Consulting

Money path:

. get clients
. get work done
. bill them

Upsides:

. 100% freedom and flexibility in picking clients, working for more than one, not working at all. You choose.
. potential for passive income through retainers, pay per performance, padding managed costs (e.g infrastructure) and partnerships

Downsides:

. client work can be pointless
. generally an exchange of your time for money with limited growth opportunities except for unicorn clients
- unicorn clients don't always work in domain you have any interest in
- dealing with legacy code and junk created by others. Almost always.



=== Business

Money path:

- unclear until it is


Upsides:

- eat your own dog food
- work on domain and problems you are interested in
- all benefits from consulting and employee when done right with little downside
- more people breathing down your neck but much less power over your life

Downside:

- 80/20 rule. 20% is good enough for you, 80% is about work you don't care about but is needed to get users. 
- all aspects have to be handled. marketing, sales, advertising. There is no excuse for "This part of the job sucks, I'm not doing it".  Do it or hire/delegate. 
- it never really ends until you sell or get acquired or hire someone to run it.
