==  objectives

. experiment with existing tech like hook.io and iron.io to prevent waste of time/energy implementing existing stuff and doing it poorly
. clarify overall system design 


== executing raw code using iron functions

=== installer docker - use deb files

https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo/pool/main/d/docker-engine/

sudo dpkg -i debfile
sudo apt-get install -f

docker version >= 1.12 needed

=== run iron functions server

server is used later on to accept calls and relay messages + start/stop docker containers

install fn server

```
cd /tmp/gg
docker run --rm -it --name functions -v ${PWD}/data:/app/data -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 8080:8080 iron/functions
```


=== install fn cli tool

used to create functions 

```
curl -LSs https://goo.gl/VZrL8t | sh
```


=== run raw php function 

clone repo and run the php example in

https://github.com/iron-io/functions/tree/master/examples/hello/php

```
gcl https://github.com/iron-io/functions
cd examples/hello/php
fn build
fn run
fn apps create hello
```

assuming the docker iron functions is running on server 8080 and data directory is the same, this will create a db file in the data directory. when iron server container is stopped, the data (apps created) is not lost


although, you can use the fn apps to create routes, you can also bypass the iron server completely. 
it doesn't seem to cache the docker image to reduce execution time. 
i dont see a difference between `

```
echo '{"name": "hh"}' | fn call hello2 /hello
```

and 
 
```
echo '{"name": "hh"}' | fn run
```

the latter doesnt require the iron functions server, nor apps or routes.



=== notes of raw functions

many languages are supported but the func.yaml file is not predictable. specifying the runtime doesn't always work and not sure what it's based on. Not 100% dockerfile and not well documented. 

multiple languages are supported and you are basically building a docker image to run the function, which means you can put whatever you want in it in terms of dependencies


=== running a process 

Example using youtube-dl

First, create the dockerfile

```
FROM atlassian/ubuntu-minimal


#COPY conf/ /opt/docker/

# Install development environment
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y python curl
RUN curl "https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" -o "get-pip.py"
RUN python get-pip.py
RUN pip install youtube-dl
```

docker build . 

docker run -t -i ... 

this allows you to run youtube-dl via docker. 
However, in order to restify, it might be worth to use https://github.com/Stackvana/microcule and build a rest interface over it. 
or faas https://github.com/alexellis/faas
microcule is used by hook.io and battle tested though.

otherwise, write a function for it (wrapper) which calls the shell script and handles the JSON.

=== conclusion

these two experiments cover most of the early functions in the registry. either raw code or a wrapper of existing processes/projects functionality.

a lot of improvements need to be made in terms of coordination but i'm much more concerned on scaling and billing. 

Scaling issue would mean the difference between managing the infrastructure or building on top of aws lambda; allowing me to focus on user visible stuff and optimize this later
billing issue is related to scaling.


=== improvements and further experiments

. build full example with multiple string functions and piping using fn run
. run test of iron functions on aws lambda -- already has fn commands
. write more on vision of all systems + ideas to further clarify things
. look into reusing containers . especially for strings and maybe if it can be accelerated further by keeping the container around (i saw a blog post from iron on that) -- possible using hot functions https://github.com/iron-io/functions/blob/master/docs/hot-functions.md
. think about billing and how to monitor resources. i can clearly monitor a container and bill accordingly but what if multiple users use the same container, do we need an additional api for billing. is it an early optimization?
