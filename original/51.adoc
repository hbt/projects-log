== target users

focus on developers from the start. 
build it for developers since it will help increase the nb functions and usage. 
Market for regular users.
If you focus on users first, you need a set of functions for that demographic. e.g you build string functions and now you are competing with other software offering text manipulation who have better interfaces and such. 

focus on allowing developers to build, release their stuff and use/integrate it with other people's stuff

focus on OSS community but it doesn't mean shit is free.
