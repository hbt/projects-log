I'd like to investigate similar ideas before even thinking about the technical design.

Maybe it can be built on top of Zapier or an existing platform instead of building everything from scratch. 

Although a lot of what I want is the equivalent of distributed functions.

== differentiators

. focus on open source tools, easy access, publishing + monetization instead of hooking to company xyz API
. focus on developers workflow (writing, publishing, testing, monetizing) -- plenty of room since most companies dont cater to developers, especially OSS
. focus on customer workflow (easy creation, billing, managing etc.) -- no major differentiators there and should be done later
. easy site / app building  -- late

. perfect explanation of the problem and solution http://pchiusano.github.io/2013-05-22/future-of-software.html  Applications can and ultimately should be replaced by programming environments, explicitly recognized as such, in which the user interactively creates, executes, inspects and composes programs. In this model, interaction with the computer is fundamentally an act of creation, the creative act of programming, of assembling language to express ideas, access information, and automate tasks

== conclusion

. ipaas etl serverless computing (function as a service faas) were the keywords I was looking for and describe the application domain
. multiple services exist but no where near what I want. Need to further review them if they can be built upon. 
. focusing on end user apps is most likely the wrong way to go. It is necessary though but maybe easier to connect to an aggregator instead. Focus should be on OSS and software inacessible to most users (due to complex install, hidden features etc.)
. it should be as easy as a google input but gets things done.
