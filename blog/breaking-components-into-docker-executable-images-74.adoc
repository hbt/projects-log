== breaking-components-into-docker-executable-images-74



## Iteration 6

OK. We have a script which does what we want. 

- Download
- convert
- upload. 


There are a few more issues

Issues:

- Sometimes I don't want to convert the video
- Sometimes I don't want to upload it and sync it to my phone. Just download it locally only.
- After listening to a video, I delete it. It gets deleted from my gdrive too. However, music videos stay. they should be uploaded to a different folder.


Normally, if you want additional features you have 2 options:

- create separate scripts 
- have one script and add arguments/parameters e.g `--sync` `--extract-audio` etc.


Now here is the problem, what I'm doing has been done before by somebody else. That solution/work is not *accessible* though. 
All of these issues have to be solved with additional scripting and *glue*...again.

So, since this is not my first rodeo, let's look into how we could make these scripts *accessible* and *useful*. 


For starters, we need to break down the project into major components. This is easy.

- youtube-dl (downloads video)
- ffmpeg (video manipulation)
- gdrive (upload/syncing)


Now, each one of these programs has tons of arguments/parameters to do complicated things. Like download a video or the whole playlist? Upload to google drive and specify which folder? Prompt or not, overwrite files or not etc.


These tools are not accessible to advanced users in the first place. They are not easy to use nor install.

That has to be the first fix. I don't want pip/go/npm/apt-get/yum/rpm or whatever. I just want to use it asap.


Ideally, I want a single binary that works cross-platform. There are a few projects like AppImage  https://appimage.org/ where the user can download one binary, that has everything needed into it and works everywhere. 
Producing said binary is a nightmare though.

Next up is Docker where you can build an image containing your binary and all its dependencies. The biggest downside ofcourse is you need docker. 
This idea is not new. People are working on contained apps https://www.opencontainers.org/ and perhaps we can come up later with a way to turn a docker image into its own executable and easy to distribute. There is even work to put the docker image into the binary. https://github.com/jessfraz/binctr

For now though, we can easily turn the 3 components above into executable containers. This guide helps https://www.infoq.com/articles/docker-executable-images



## Dockerfy all executables


Dockerfy all 3 executables into their images. 


Let's start with ffmpeg

.Dockerfile
[source, Dockerfile]
----
FROM ubuntu:16.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ffmpeg sudo

# Add a user that can `sudo`.
RUN useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash user \
 && echo "user ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/use

# Don't be root.
USER user
ENV HOME /home/user


ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/ffmpeg"]
----


.docker-compose.yml
[source, yaml]
----
version: '3'

services: 
  ffmpeg:
    build:  
      context: . 
    image: hbtlabs/ffmpeg
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - $PWD:/mounted
    networks:
      hostnet: {} 
    working_dir: /mounted      
      

# needed because docker-compose create an additional network layer and that doesnt play well with VPN/Proxies
networks:
  hostnet:
    external:
      name: host        
      
----


Usage:

`docker-compose run  ffmpeg -i test/v.webm -vn test/v.mp3`



Let's improve it further and remove the docker-compose part. 

.ffmpeg
[source, bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

docker-compose -f /home/hassen/workspace/docker-files/ffmpeg/docker-compose.yml run --rm ffmpeg "$@"
----

Now, usable in the cli as `ffmpeg`


Repeat the same thing with `youtube-dl` and `drive`
