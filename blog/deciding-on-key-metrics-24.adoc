== deciding-on-key-metrics-24




It's easy to get lost with next features. Metrics kinda help maintain focus on what matters.


== What matters is what the user wants


. get what they want
. get it done with the least amount of effort
. get it done as fast as possible
. get it done for the least amount of money


This translates to:

. a rich library of functions/api/integrations to get things done
. minimal effort required to stitch things together using a UI or vocal interface 
. reduce execution time of functions
. reduce cost of cloud computing


So, any feature should:

. increase the number of functions
. decrease the number of steps to get things done
. decrease the computing time
. decrease the price
