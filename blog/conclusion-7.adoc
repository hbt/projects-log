== Conclusion



Definitely not worth monetizing. The white flash crowd is loud but they are not that numerous. 
Although, I do get 50 unique visitors a week now as of Jan 2017. Very few follow through and download the binaries (for ubuntu).
Shoulda tracked the windows ones.





I guess some are intimated or lost by the repository page and expect something more friendly. 


The primary goal of recruiting collaborators and advanced users was reached though.

- Jonathan forked and built on top of my fix and did a great job fixing the colors [https://github.com/imatimba/darker-chromium](https://github.com/imatimba/darker-chromium)
- he will be providing weekly stable windows binaries
- I'm deep enough in the white flash community to know when something better comes along. Like the jollo.org guy who got notified because he put his work out there. 

Too small a market and too much work (marketing, support, updates) for little pay despite all the voiced frustrations.
Maybe I could have known this from the google search results, product forums views, google trends and such. I was counting on people being as frustrated as I am with the bug to justify using a fork. Few are.


Still worth fixing for myself and still worth sharing since other people built on top the fix and improved the solution.


Putting the project on hold for now.
