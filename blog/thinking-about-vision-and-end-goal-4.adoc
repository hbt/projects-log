Ideally, I want the white flash bug fixed in google chrome so I dont have to maintain a fork in the first place. 

However, since that's not going to happen anytime soon and I have no interest in digging my heels into the codebase. Here. we. are.


There are 2 aspects to maintaining the fork:

1. stable binaries to be produced using the latest stable code
1. dealing with any merge conflicts as we update the code


Since the changes are minimal, merge conflicts shouldn't be a problem. 

It would be great to somewhat automate the browser updating part. Problem is, it's a giant pain in the ass and is time consuming to build for my platform, let alone other platforms. Dependency hell is waiting to happen, I just know it. 

Maybe have a VM and produce the binaries there. 

There is some demand online for a fix, maybe it can be made economically viable so the costs for renting a VM + keeping up the latest version is spread amongst collaborators and customers.
