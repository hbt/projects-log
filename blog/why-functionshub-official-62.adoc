== why-functionshub-official-62




Although there are a few blog posts out there, I wanted to clarify the vision in a way that anyone can get it. 

Understanding why functionshub must be built.


A few blog posts to draw inspiration from:

. good comment on hn regarding problem of deploying OSS (financial and operational) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14091409
. perfect explanation of the problem and solution http://pchiusano.github.io/2013-05-22/future-of-software.html  - Since the solution he implemented is much different but we both agree on the problem. outline your solution 
.. followup http://pchiusano.github.io/2013-09-10/type-systems-and-ux-example.html http://unisonweb.org/2015-05-07/about.html
- good format http://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/why-kakoune.html

// TODO(hbt) NEXT review old vision posts



== why functionshub

== effectiveness and getting the job done

. why we use software in the first place

. issues with modern software

- increasing frustration
- software ux learning curve
- inability to connect things together without a lot plumbing
- communicating between programs - clojure guy talk
- inaccessible open source
. api deprecation and sites/services disappearing
. it used to work, the fuck happened?
. I only need that one thing, dont care about the rest
. programming plumbing 
. stackoverflow and ide and machine learning
. inability to sell software easily or use it easily - app like instead of subscriptions and such
. pay per use vs artificial scarcity
- integration platforms and competitors
- accelerate automation, information economy, ability to manipulate and accessibility
- scalability portability accessibility easiness
- emphasis on good old unix design . do one thing and do it well
- the next level of usability in github repo


- system design aspect and specing a new function / new functionality
- jobs and contributing
- oss contributing and monetization - like that project
