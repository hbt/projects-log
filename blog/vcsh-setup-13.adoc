== vcsh setup



== my setup 

We have 4 environments minimium. 

- Desktop - local/personal environment
- laptop - still personal but slightly different than desktop
- servers - personal servers
- work servers - consulting/public servers


This means 4 repositories. 


Each repository has 2 branches.

- common - anything in common between repositories
- private - the stuff that only pertains to that environment


All repositories are checked in on the desktop. One private branch and 3 common branches.

The other environments only have access to their respective repositories. 

If something needs to be shared, it is shared on the common branch.



[source,bash]
----
vcsh init dotfiles
vcsh init hbtlabs_dotfiles 

# hide all files from status unless I specifically add them
# downside: if a new file is added to a tracked directory, it will not appear in status. 
vcsh  dotfiles_hbtlabs config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no

vcsh enter dotfiles_hbtlabs

# regular git commands
