== vcsh setup



== my setup 

We have 4 environments minimium. 

- Desktop - local/personal environment
- laptop - still personal but slightly different than desktop
- servers - personal servers
- work servers - consulting/public servers


This means 4 repositories. 


Each repository has 2 branches.

- common - anything in common between repositories
- private - the stuff that only pertains to that environment


All repositories are checked in on the desktop. One private branch and 3 common branches.

The other environments only have access to their respective repositories. 

If something needs to be shared, it is shared on the common branch.

vcsh init dotfiles
vcsh init hbtlabs_dotfiles 

# hide all files from status unless I specifically add them
# downside: if a new file is added to a tracked directory, it will not appear in status. 
vcsh  dotfiles_hbtlabs config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no

vcsh enter dotfiles_hbtlabs
