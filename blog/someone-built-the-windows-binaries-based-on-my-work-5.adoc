== Someone built the windows binaries based on my work ;-)




Since getting the word out on the chromium bug tracker [https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=470669](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=470669), people visited the repo and downloaded the binaries. 


Not that many people though. About 25 visitors in December 2016 but increased to 53 visitors. 

The best part is somewhat built the binaries for windows and that got people's attention. 

I want to help advertise the windows binaries and get feedback.
