== analysis



== book idea

=== existing work

After a bit of research, most of it looks done

. https://dotfiles.github.io/
offers list of dotfiles solutions and quick comparison

. https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles
offers guides for vcsh and how to set up


== vcsh improvements

=== improvements analysis

. vcsh improvements (syncing, auto-detecting files, tight integration (like etckeeper), easier set up + manipulation)
. extend to etckeeper
. sane integrations with zsh/bash/fish 

Conclusion:

. This will either turn into a bash script nightmare or require a python/ruby dependency dissuading many users. 
. Little reason to implement since already satisfied with current solution
. Improvements are too minor to justify paying and big risk of "do what I mean syndrome" with feature like auto-detection, tight integration etc.


=== dotfiles community

Found one http://dotshare.it/

The sharing part is solved via github. dotshare.it offers a centralized location but users have to manually upload their config. 
It's more about presenting your config to the world.

==== Key problems:

- discovery -- finding examples and options usage
- understanding the configuration -- reliance on comments on config if any or looking up documentation (no integration)

==== Current solutions:

. clunky github search by filename and option and browsing each file
.. https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=.pentadactylrc+in%3Apath&type=Code&ref=searchresults
. documentation is scattered and no linkage between the 2


==== vision 


- github dotfiles are scanned 
- project documentation is loaded / converted like an API and linkable instead of raw text
- view a dotfile, options/commands are clickable with ref to documentation instead of relying on live comments
- ability to view alternatives e.g `bind-sym` would display alternative usage/examples for that command


==== Roadmap

===== building db

. as a user, I want to search .screenrc configurations. I use github search and search by filename but have to browse a bunch of empty or redundant files
.. dotfiles would index github dotfiles, analyze them (by commands/options usage, length etc.) and display the most interesting ones
.. when reading the file, it would be linked to the program manual


===== improving documentation

. as a user, I want to look up a definition from a file `e.g screenrc bind-sym` and find other examples + read what it means
.. dotfiles makes `bind-sym` clickable and refs to documentation
.. dotfiles lists examples of other configs using `bind-sym`
.. dotfiles imports program documentation and makes reversable -- i.e click from the documentation and find examples/usage
.. dotfiles provides a visualization for specific commands e.g set prompt or themes 

NOTE: The idea of linking documentation to code is a good one but not new and often poorly executed due to its complexity. Example: linking API documentation to code examples on github. Kinda like the old google code search.


===== beyond dotfiles

dotfiles. as a user, I customize other programs such as IDE (code templates, settings etc.), chrome extensions (mouseless mappings/settings), gnome (.config/dconf) and dump those customizations into a file for backups. Can these be improved/analyzed/discovered?
