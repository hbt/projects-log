== dockerfication-and-scaling-73




## Iteration 5


Issues:

- maintaining the state of the remote machine is annoying. e.g upgrading youtube-dl and making sure things don't break
- cannot have dedicated vm for just a script. installing other software could break the script by unintentionally upgrading other libraries
- ffmpeg consumes a whole CPU and also takes time
- copy/pasting multiple urls manually is time consuming.

### Software dependencies and deployment issues

Use containers instead of only VMs. 

Dockerfy the whole project and its dependencies. Deploy locally or on any vm easy and use easily.

.Dockerfile
[source,Dockerfile]

FROM ubuntu:16.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl git python g++ build-essential python-pip ffmpeg sudo php7.0

# install youtube-dl
RUN pip install youtube-dl

# Install drive
RUN mkdir -p /goroot && \
    curl https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.8.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xvzf - -C /goroot --strip-components=1
ENV GOROOT /goroot

.docker-compose.yml
[source,yaml]
----

version: '3'

services: 
  video-converter:
    build:  
      context: . 
    image: hbtlabs/video-converter
    volumes:
      - .:/home/user/project
      - /tmp/linux-tmp/gdrive/.gd/credentials.json:/home/user/credentials.json

----


Usage

docker-compose run --rm -d video-converter ./video-converter.sh


### CPU Issues

push the image on docker hub and scale up in the VM or using https://www.hyper.sh/


### Copy/pasting links

Use mouseless `yankWindowUrls` https://hbt.github.io/mouseless/commands.html



### Recap


- We have our automation script and it can be deployed anywhere (including locally) 
- Although local resources are limited, we can easily scale up in the cloud and process an entire playlist of videos
- Pretty much majority of users could not have achieved this without serious software development chops 
- Although a docker image is available, it is not easily discoverable nor accessible and requires too much work to use (install docker etc.)
- As a developer, all of this took too much time and work and is still somewhat clunky.
- Any additional features require more scripting/coding and work
- Tons of programming plumbing to glue things together


The most frustrating part here is that I did really build anything. youtube-dl, ffmpeg, drive and docker are the core utilities. I just wasted my time glueing things together so they can communicate. *That's the problem with programming plumbing*.


## What if 

- all these utilities provided a machine interface other than raw text?
- the output of one could be fed/piped into another without parsing and plumbing?
- all these tools were available as building blocks online?
- you could connect those blocks, execute them locally and if you don't have the computational resources, you execute them on the cloud easily?
- you could easily share your solution and people could easily *discover* your solution?
