== future-of-oss-25




Been thinking about the future of open source and it's becoming increasingly clear that this platform would be essential.


Currently, if you write OSS, you can push it to github and that's about it. The hosting aspect is handled. Which is great but what about all the other aspects:

- publishing the code 
- reaching an audience
- monetizing your work 
- having your work easily integrated 


With something like cw, you could write your function/utility, push it on github and it would be available on the platform:

- users can find it ala google search
- use it easily (web UI + apis/cli/apps etc)
- not worry about scaling it (serverless computing / faas)
- have it integrated to a wealth of existing apis
- gather a wealth of data on how people use it and how it could be improved/optimized

You don't have to do:

- marketing/sales
- figure out pricing / billing / invoice
- customer support
- releases / platforms / version management / dependencies / software management / plumbing crap


Just focus on the core system functionality, the actual value and making it better


I can't recall the name of that company that had a blockchain p2p revenue sharing based on contribution startup building idea but collected 20% of revenues not even profits. Anyway, those incentives could be applied in a system like this. 

You have a lot of incentives:

- keep prices low
- maintain and merge optimizations
- revenue share based on OSS contributions

Even if you keep it proprietary, it would have to be google good. Otherwise, people can switch easily to another search engine that produces the same/better results.
