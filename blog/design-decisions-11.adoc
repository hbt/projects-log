== design decisions



== asciidoctor

Switched to using asciidoctor over markdown. Looks much better. Wasted time confusing asciidoc and asciidoctor thinking they were the same thing. God damn open source names. 


== jekyll

Disregarded jekyll completely. I render the asciidoc to html myself and serve it via docs. Why? configuring github pages to match my local jekyll instances looks like its own hell.

== final design

. directories
.. ``original`` contains all posts. they are numbered and controlled via map.php for easier manipulation + reorganization
.. ``blog`` contains all posts renamed for url friendlyness. titles are dynamic. do not edit. generated from ``original/scripts/build-index.php``
.. ``docs`` contains all html stuff transformed blog. designed for github pages so it simply renders them as is and doesn't do anything extra

. files
.. `original/map.php` site map -- used as the index. controls blog/[filenames] 
.. ``original/scripts/build-index.php`` watch files and render blog + create html files in docs/
.. ``original/index-tmpl.adoc`` template files used to generate ``blog/index.adoc``

== usage

```
# watch files and render blog + create html files in docs/
cd original
wf scripts/build-index.php

# auto-create files, rename and organize 
map.php

# wip/wgp 
commit changes and push
```

== improvements

. use jekyll at least locally to benefit from things such as layout and such. for now, layout is injected via header in ``original/scripts/build-index.php``
