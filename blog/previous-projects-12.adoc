== timeline

- starting around 2003: accumulation of small scripts 
- 2007: switching to linux 100% (no longer needing windows for college work)
- 2008: beginning to store scripts, dotfiles, configuration and such under svn 
- 2012: migrating from svn to config (git repo) and organizing scripts/dotfiles. Nothing is ever lost and everything configured properly.
- 2016: migrating git repo to vcsh


## the key requirements

## version control

all customized files tracked and stored on a remote server. easy to revert, easy to experiment.

## multiple environments

The ability to login into a remote machine and have my aliases, functions, scripts etc. available without having to maintain multiple locations etc.

## share between environments

have scripts/aliases for my local computer and public/common stuff for remote computers.



## the tools available.


In 2012, I implemented the symlink idea. dotfiles are symlinks and actual file is stored in folder under git. 
Managing multiple environments using git branches.

This works out great except for:

- dealing with merges and merge conflicts + picking what to commit etc. i.e a lot of work
- symlinks creating issues for certain files e.g .zhistory 
- extra work/maintenance


In 2016, found out about https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh which allows you to manage multiple git repositories.
This is perfect as each environment can be its own repository and no more merge problems.



During that time, oh-my-zsh, prezto and other frameworks surged. Frankly, I don't think you need a framework. 
You can organize all your shell scripts under directories and source them. Essentially, that's what those frameworks do. 
They don't provide a solution for other dotfiles.
