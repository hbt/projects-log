== Stick to advanced users.




the cvim repo doesnt look maintained anymore and I've been adding features left and right. 

I think that's what I really want:

- target advanced users, developers and potential contributors
- make it a cluster fuck of features and options that are not enabled but available for mapping. i.e 100% the complete opposite of vimium
- embrace the organized chaos
- make sure it works top notch 
- build a community of advanced users 


You can benefit in many ways:

## Good pull requests

- Stuff like the recent pull for the manifest to be compatible with latest chrome canary. I wouldn't have experienced that until I updated the browser and the manifest didn't load then spend time debugging and figuring out. That's fucking maintenance and avoided thanks to that pull request.
- Optimizations 


## Discovery 

- People sharing cool new commands or features that match my browsing pattern and I wouldn't have thought of. 
- interesting configs and such e.g cvim CSS hints, cool mappings, custom functions etc.

## wanted features / wanted help

- better tab completion, CLI etc.


## small community of contributors / advanced users

- generate serependity


I already attracted people sending pull requests, contacting my fork for feature requests and following/starring me. That's without any:
 
- quality - better documentation
- marketing - mainly having a homepage + rebranding + sharing on google chrome
- recruiting - approaching the watchers and forkers
- encouraging advanced users - having examples of configs, sharing configs/mappings etc.


One thing is certain, I don't want to turn this into a job doing support. It has to be economically viable (time, money, energy).

Maybe monetize parts of the documentation like the guides. Advanced users are already familiar with vim or pentadactyl and will skip the guide.

Monetizing the extension itself on the chrome store would be kinda scummy since I didn't write it and the free version is right next door. However, it would filter out the crowd. I'd still keep the code open source but charge for it anyway.


There has to be some business model around this that doesn't suck and makes the maintenance + community moderation a breeze .

Get more people who are most likely to be contributors rather than passive watchers. That's why, fuck the average user and focus on advanced users.
